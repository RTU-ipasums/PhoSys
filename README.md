<h4 align="center"> A simple to use, web-based photonics simulator. Based on <a href="https://github.com/flaport">Flaport's<a/> <a href="https://github.com/flaport/fdtd">fdtd<a/> library.</h4>

PhoSys is an open-source, web-based FDTD electromagnetic wave simulator. The project's primary objective is to assist teachers, students, and individuals interested in studying photonics or electromagnetic waves by offering a visualization tool for various electromagnetic phenomena in a simple and intuitive manner. Although the functionality is currently limited due to being in the early stages of development, you can still create visually interesting simulations using the three fundamental objects: point sources, line sources, and rectangle objects.

# Motivation

We decided to create Phosys because one day, during a physics class about electromagnetic waves, our team had a discussion and couldn't agree on a certain question. We wanted to resolve this question by simulating the problem, but we soon realized that there weren't any easy-to-use tools available. The simulation tools we found were either too complicated and expensive, like Ansys Lumerical, or too basic and didn't allow us to check what we wanted, like the [simulations provided by the University of Colorado Boulder](https://phet.colorado.edu/).

# How To Use
A demo page is currently hosted on [phosys.lv](https://phosys.lv). Although mobile use is supported, it is highly recommended to use a desktop device.

# How to host
To run this application, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) and Python 3.10+ installed on your computer.
Optionally you can use Conda to create an isolated environment with the commmand `conda create -n phosys python=3.3.0` and activate it each time with:
```
conda activate
conda activate phosys
```

After cloning the repository open two terminals and run:
```
cd frontend
npm i
npm run dev
```
And:
```
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask --app main.py --debug run
```
(`npm i` and `pip install` are only required to update/install)

# Technical description

## Directory structure
The directory structure is very simple. All frontend code is in the `frontend` directory, all backend code is in the `backend` directory.

## UI Design
![UI overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47260097/242680617-3a3ae81e-4771-4708-8262-22a1ea9c170f.png)

The PhoSys user interface consists of 4 main parts:
  * [Toolbar](#toolbar)
  * [Properties panel](#properties-panel)
  * [Canvas](#canvas)
  * [Simulation result panel](#simulation-result-panel)

The interface was made with the [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) JavaScript framework and the Vue [Splitpanes](https://antoniandre.github.io/splitpanes/) component, which were used to create a responsive and modern UI with user resizable panels. Additionally the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icon library was used for some icons.

The UI is split up into 5 Vue components. Furthermore, there is a Vue component for each type of object in the `shapes` subdirectory.

  * `App.vue` - The main component that has the toolbar and all other components
  * `Draw.vue` - The canvas component, this component also uses shape components from the `shapes` subdirectory
  * `Properties.vue` - The properties panel component
  * `Result.vue` - The component responsible for showing the result of the simulation
  * `SeekBar.vue` - The component that has all of the controls for simulation playback

## Toolbar
The toolbar contains useful icons for interacting with the canvas and simulation

## Properties panel
The properties panel lists all of the properties of the selected object or global simulation properties if a single object isn't selected. It also has additional information about the object, such as it's position and name.

Here is a list of all the properties that are currently editable by the user:
### Global properties
  * Permittivity
  * Permiability
### Rectangle object
  * Permittivity
  * Conductivity
### Point source
  * Wavelength
  * Amplitude
  * Phase shift
### Line source
  * Wavelength
  * Amplitude
  * Phase shift

## Canvas
This is the most important part of the PhoSys user interface. The simulation canvas is used for adding objects to the simulation. 

Here is a list of features the canvas editor currently supports:
  * Scene navigation (pan and zoom with left-click and scroll wheel)
  * Multi-touch zooming on mobile
  * Object adding and deleting with <kbd>Del</kbd>
  * Multi-object selection while holding <kbd>â‡§ Shift</kbd>
  * Object transformation (moving, scaling and rotating)
  * Incremental object moving with arrow keys
  * Rotation snapping while holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
  * Object copy/paste with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>
  
PhoSys uses the [Konva.js](https://konvajs.org/) javascript library to draw objects to a canvas. Konva additionally provides an easy way of adding object transformation control, but all other features had to be added on top.

### Object data storage
All information nessecary to draw and simulate an object is stored in a JavaScript object called `data` defined in the `data.js` file. This object also contains information about global simulation properties.
Whenever a shape icon in the toolbar is clicked, an object from the `defaultObjects.js` file is added to the `shapes` array in the `data` object. The `Draw.vue` component passes shape properties from the `shapes` array to their respective shape components. Each of these components update their respective properties after they have been transformed in the Konva canvas to ensure the data accurately represents what is being shown on the canvas.

All shapes have a property `name` that allows them to be uniquely identified in the canvas. Each shape also stores information about their properties, which gets displayed in the properties panel.

Storing the information about objects in this centralized way allows for easy loading/saving of canvas objects and a simple way to send object information to the server without including any unnecessary data.

## Simulation result panel

This panel is used for displaying the result of the simulation recieved from the server.

### Simulation playback controls

![Playback controls](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47260097/242866407-41118bca-abd9-46ee-8c6f-572d3b040b70.png)

1. Current frame number
2. Simulation playback framerate (experimental)
3. Playback controls. From left-to-right: 
    * Go to beginning
    * Previous frame
    * Play/pause
    * Next frame
    * Go to end
4. Seek bar. Used for scrubbing through the simulation. Because the simulation generates sequentally, you can only seek to already generated frames.
5. Final frame number. Determines the final frame to which the simulation will generate. This can be set manually or by pressing play again after the simulation reaches the final frame, in which case it will keep generating forever.

## Backend design

Uses an electromagnetic FDTD simulation based on [Flaport's](https://github.com/flaport) [fdtd](https://github.com/flaport/fdtd) library. More information on how the simulation works is available on the library's GitHub page.
